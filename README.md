# **ATM Project**
##### Course: COP 3710 - Intro to Data Engineering
##### Instructor: Professor Greenwell
##### Semester: Spring 2019
### **Description** 
This was a semester long project that assigned us with the task of creating a general database for 
an ATM Management System. ATM's will all be ran by the same company; meaning that all transactions numbers will 
be shared, set mechanically per ATM, and all ATM's will be assigned to several different banks and accounts.

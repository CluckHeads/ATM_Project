# **ATM Project**
##### Course: COP 3710 - Intro to Data Engineering
##### Instructor: Professor Greenwell
##### Semester: Spring 2019
### **Description** 
We are tasked with creating a general database for an ATM Management System. These ATMs are ran
by the same company so transaction numbers are shared, mechanically set per ATM, but are assigned
to several different banks and accounts. System should allow for tracking money in member accounts,
the ATMs, and the banks attached to each other. System should allow for updating a new member and
account based on provided JSON files. They should also run simple statistical and analytic methods using
aggregated functions and programming code.
